    <string name="tools_app_description">Aplikasi ini merupakan sebuah hasil pengembangan teknologi yang dirancang khusus untuk mengukur dan mendeteksi tingkat kematangan hasil roasting biji kopi jenis robusta. Aplikasi ini memungkinkan pemanggang kopi untuk secara real-time memantau tingkat kematangan biji kopi yang sedang diroasting. Ini dilakukan dengan mendeteksi citra dari objek  yang terintegrasi dalam model Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) untuk dapat menentukan profile roasting (light, medium, dark). Pada aplikasi ini, pengguna juga dapat melihat informasi tambahan terkait kopi robusta dan data profil roasting biji kopi robusta.</string>
